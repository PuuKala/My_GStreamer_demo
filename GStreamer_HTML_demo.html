Copy the following line to the terminal for GStreamer to start streaming test video in correct format:

gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc is-live=true horizontal-speed=1 ! theoraenc ! oggmux ! tcpserversink host=127.0.0.1 port=8080

It will show the test video scrolling to the left. It seems to have some hiccups every now and then, but works flawlessly aside from that. The
videotestsrc along with its parameters can be changed to autovideosrc for webcam feed.

For sound and video, you can start GStreamer with the following line:

gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc is-live=true horizontal-speed=1 ! theoraenc ! mux. audiotestsrc ! vorbisenc ! mux. oggmux name=mux ! tcpserversink host=127.0.0.1 port=8080

Just like for the previous line for only video, you can replace videotestsrc with autovideosrc and audiotestsrc with autoaudiosrc for webcam+mic
feed.

            not be changed though, as for some reason the other alternative for Html5 video, mp4, doesn't work to Html5 from GStreamer.
            Also, for the Html5, the protocol needs to be TCP from GStreamer. -->

    <p>For some reason the autoplay tag doesn't always work... You'll need to push the play button yourself in this case.</p>
    <p>The audio works fine, but the video works after you've started playing and move the progress slider closer to the end.</p>
    <p>However, if it's pushed all the way to the end, there might not be enough buffer for the video, in which case you can pull the progress slider back a bit.</p>
